# Monster Music Mixer

On this website our monster icons seen on the bottom bar can be dragged into the main box to activate the various sounds and music. With four regions, you can play four different overlapping tracks to make your own song. If you would like to make a different sounding song, you may reload the page and rearrange them. 


### Getting Started

With the first checkpoint, we have included several of our base assets for continuing our project in the future. These assets include PSD, AI and JPG files to show our progress in creating the design part of the website.


### Prerequisites

Just an editor and Git!
